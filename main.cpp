 * Program: Matrix Row Reduce Echelon Form Calculator (C++)
 * Author: John Kaufman
 * Date of Program Creation: 3/16/2021
 * Date of Program Competion: Work in Progress
 *
 * Description: This program performs a series of elementary row operations on a matrix
 * 		to transform the matrix into its row redeuced echelon form (RREF)
 *
 * Input: Input is provided in 2 phases:
 * 		First, the user enters the number of vectors in the matrix, and the dimension of the matrix
 * 		Second, the user enters a number of values corresponding to the number of vectors multiplied by the dimension of the matrix.
 *
 * 		(Note on input: Each column corresponds to a vector)
 *
 * Output: After translating the matrix to its RREF, the program will output the resulting matrix to the terminal
